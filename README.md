# ymlite
![Release version](https://img.shields.io/badge/alpha-v0.1.0-red.svg)

A light-weight single-include C++ YAML library, relying on KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple)
convention and C++11 STL (similar to my other library jsonlite).


# Overview

Yes, this library is designed to aim for fast compilation times, simplicity and
ease of use, nothing else.


# C bindings

Yet again bindings for C are planned like with my other jsonlite library.


# Licensing

As stated, this project follows the MIT license.
